### Content

Our project focuses on animation software, which are important for animators. My partner and I explored three main programs: **Procreate**, a drawing app for iPad users that offers customizable brushes and animation assist features; **Adobe Animate**, which facilitates vector animations and is designed for web and app use; and **Blender**, an open-source 3D creation software that offers a complete set of tools for 3D modeling and animation. Additionally, we looked into essential hardware for animation creation, like the **Huion Kamvas Pro** tablet for detailed drawing, **NVIDIA RTX graphics cards** for rendering complex animations, and the **MPC One Sampler/Sequencer** for sound design in animations. We also discussed future inventions like **Emotion-Driven Animation**, which uses AI to adjust animated scenes based on emotional input, and **Holo-Directional Projection**, which creates interactive 3D animations in real space.

### EDP

In our engineering design process, we are currently in the **research phase**, where we gather information about existing animation software and hardware. Our next step will be **planning the most promising solution**, where we will determine how to put these tools into our animation project effectively.

### Skills

Through this project, I have developed **communication** and **problem decomposition** skills. For communication, Iâ€™ve enhanced my ability to share ideas clearly to my partner, which is useful for effective collaboration. We share our thoughts and feedback on different parts of the project, which helps the overall flow of our work. Regarding problem decomposition, I learned how to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts. This skill helps me address issues step-by-step rather than feeling overwhelmed by the whole project at once. By understanding each part better, I can handle challenges more effectively.
