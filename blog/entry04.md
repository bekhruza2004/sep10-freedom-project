## Content
For my tool, I chose Bulma, a CSS framework. I started with watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iXItWKbaQxcyDT1u6E7a8a">YouTube playlist about Bulma CSS</a>, where I learned about the basic components like fonts, spacing, and containers. After learning some of these elements, I started tinkering with the framework. I used a live server website where I utilized Bulma's css to make my content. I tested different design elements, changing colors and trying out spacing. I frequently referred to the <a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/">Bulma documentation</a> to clarify concepts and find the right classes for my needs. Although I encountered some bugs—like misaligned elements or styling issues—I kept going, debugging my code by reading error messages and testing various changes until I found solutions. Each challenge turned into a learning opportunity, helping my understanding of Bulma.

### Here is my tinkering:

## Skills
Working with Bulma has helped me develop two skills: debugging and embracing failure. When I faced errors in my code, whether it was a layout issue or a styling problem, I learned to read the messages carefully and troubleshoot effectively. This process improved my patience and problem-solving abilities. I was frustrated when my designs didn’t turn out to be what I expected, but I learned to see these mistakes as valuable lessons. Each error helped my understanding of Bulma.
