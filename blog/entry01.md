<h1>Content</h1>
<p>Iâ€™ve decided to focus on animation as my topic. I chose this topic because animation influences how stories are told across various platforms. It bridges creativity and technology, showcasing how visual storytelling can evoke emotions and capture audiences' imaginations. Additionally, I am fascinated by the diverse techniques and styles within animation.</p>
<h2>Engineering Design Process</h2>
<p>I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem. The problem I hope to solve with my project is that there is a lack of understanding about the different techniques and styles in animation. In the next stage, I plan to research this issue by reviewing articles and websites.</p>
