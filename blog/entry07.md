## Content

When I gave my Expo elevator pitch I realized I should have explained my future invention in more detail. I didn’t talk enough about how it could be used later on. This made it harder for people to see how useful it could be. During my in-class presentation I learned that I need to make better eye contact. I also need to speak louder so everyone can hear me. These are things I should work on to improve my presentations in the future.

## EDP

I am at the final step of the engineering design process which is to communicate the results. I have already tested and improved my product so now I’m sharing what I made and what I learned.

## Skills

I got better at debugging by learning how to read errors and fix problems by trying different things. This helps me solve issues in other areas too. I also improved my time management by making a plan and focusing on the most important tasks first. These skills will help me stay organized.

## Overview

The purpose of the Freedom Project was to create an informal website that talks about present and future technology related to a topic you are interested in. I chose animation because it’s something I’m really interested in. Throughout the year I worked on the project and took notes on blogs like a journal. I started by researching current technology used in animation and then came up with an idea for a future invention. I also learned how to use tools like HTML, CSS, an IDE for GitHub, and a personal tool which for me was Bulma CSS to build the final project. My project could have a positive impact on society by showing how animation technology can grow and help people understand stories better. A possible negative impact is that some people might rely on future tools and forget to build actual skills for animation.

Here is my final project: [SEP10 Freedom Project](https://bekhruza2004.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/)
