## Content

When I gave my Expo elevator pitch, I realized I should have explained my future invention in more detail. I didn’t talk enough about how it could be used later on. This made it harder for people to see how useful it could be. During my in-class presentation, I learned that I need to make better eye contact. I also need to speak louder so everyone can hear me. These are things I should work on to improve my presentations in the future.

## EDP

I am at the final step of the engineering design process which is to communicate the results. I have already tested and improved my product so now I’m sharing what I made and what I learned.

## Skills

I got better at debugging by learning how to read errors and fix problems by trying different things. This helps me solve issues in other areas too. I also improved my time management by making a plan and focusing on the most important tasks first. These skills will help me stay organized.
