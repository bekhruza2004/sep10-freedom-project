## Content

One of the things I learned is how simple it is to use Bulma compared to writing CSS. With Bulma, you can create layouts quickly without worrying too much about complicated CSS. The framework provides classes that make it simple to style elements quickly. I learned Bulma by going through the [official Bulma documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/). The documentation is very clear and includes examples for each component, which made it easier for me to understand how everything works. I also watched a helpful playlist on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iXItWKbaQxcyDT1u6E7a8a) that gave me practical examples and tutorials on how to use Bulma in projects. I tried using Bulma to create different layouts. For example, I made a website with a navigation bar, some cards, and a footer. Here's a code snippet of how I added a button class in Bulma:

```
<button class="button is-primary">Click Me!</button>
```
This code creates a nice blue button using just a single class from Bulma. I also experimented with different color classes.

## Skills

One skill I developed is problem decomposition. I listed out all the components I needed to create, like the header, footer, and content area. By focusing on one section at a time, I made it easier to see what needed to be done. Another skill I improved is debugging. I encountered some errors, but by experimenting with different changes, I learned how to spot mistakes in my code. I learned to experiment by tinkering with my code until I got the right results.
