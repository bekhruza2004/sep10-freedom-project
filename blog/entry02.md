## Content

In my recent research on software and hardware technologies pertinent to our animation project, I discovered several invaluable tools. One standout software is **Procreate**, a professional drawing app tailored for the iPad, which offers customizable brushes, high-resolution canvases, and user-friendly multi-touch gestures, making it ideal for artists and illustrators. Additionally, **Pencil2D** emerged as a great open-source option for 2D animation, featuring a simple interface for beginners, layering options for drawings and sounds, and export capabilities to movie formats. Another powerful tool is **OpenToonz**, a free animation production software known for advanced traditional animation tools and robust integration with studio workflows.

On the hardware side, I found **Huion Kamvas Pro**, a versatile pen display tablet known for its wide color gamut and customizable controls, making it an excellent choice for digital artists. The **MPC One Sampler/Sequencer** also caught my attention as a standalone music production center that can enhance our animated projects with rich soundscapes. For 3D modeling and animation, the **3Dconnexion SpaceMouse** offers intuitive navigation, while the high-performance **NVIDIA RTX Series graphics cards** are crucial for rendering complex animations in real-time. Lastly, **Canon EOS Series cameras** are frequently used for high-quality stop motion animation, ensuring that our visual storytelling is both dynamic and engaging. This collection of software and hardware will significantly inform and elevate our animation process as we move forward. 

## EDP

Currently, I am in the development phase of the Engineering Design Process (EDP). In this stage, we are actively building and refining our project based on the foundational research we have conducted. We are iterating on our concepts, testing prototypes, and gathering feedback to improve our design continually.

## Skills

Since my last blog entry, I have developed my organization skills significantly by structuring my research findings systematically. This organization facilitates easier access to information when I need to reference it. I have developed a system for prioritizing tasks based on their deadlines and significance. By scheduling work effectively, I ensure all aspects of our projects are completed promptly, preventing last-minute rushes and stress.
