## Content

In my exploration of software and hardware technologies relevant to our project, I discovered a variety of tools and platforms that can enhance our development process. Specifically, I researched:

Software Technologies: We are looking into cloud computing services like AWS and Microsoft Azure, which offer robust infrastructure and flexibility for deployment. Additionally, I analyzed different programming frameworks such as React for front-end development and Node.js for back-end operations. These frameworks allow for efficient coding practices, reducing time spent on development while increasing functionality.

Hardware Technologies: I investigated various microcontrollers and development boards, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, which can be instrumental in prototyping. These devices provide an excellent platform for testing our ideas in a real-world environment and offer numerous community resources for troubleshooting and guidance.

## EDP

Currently, I am in the development phase of the Engineering Design Process (EDP). In this stage, we are actively building and refining our project based on the foundational research we have conducted. We are iterating on our concepts, testing prototypes, and gathering feedback to improve our design continually.

## Skills

Since my last blog entry, I have developed my organization skills significantly by structuring my research findings systematically. This organization facilitates easier access to information when I need to reference it. I have developed a system for prioritizing tasks based on their deadlines and significance. By scheduling work effectively, I ensure all aspects of our projects are completed promptly, preventing last-minute rushes and stress.
